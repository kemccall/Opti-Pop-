# Opti-Pop-
An IoT device that announces when fresh popcorn is available in the Wind River cafeteria. 

#Overview

A non-contact, infrared temperature sensor aimed at the popcorn kettle, determines when the popcorn has finished its popping cycle. The device wirelessly sends an alert. The Opti-Pop! goes beyond simply alerting when the popper has been turned on. The Opti-Pop! alerts immediately after the popcorn has popped, while it is still hot.
